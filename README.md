# hello-world
Just a test repository to get used to working with Git.

Hello Humans of the world. I am a 43 year old computer programming noob who started to dice into the daunting world of computer programming and game development.
For the most years in my past, I was helping to produce and develop visual effects for blockbuster feature films, working at companies like WETA Digital, Framestore or MPC. Since I was mainly working in production, managing and organising work, I only rarely happened to do the work myself, but supervised and produced.

Programming and game development gives me the chance to actually sit in the driver seat again and do something creative myself instead of managing and organsing the creative.

Basically I switched worlds again and with a switch comes the fact, that I have to leave my power position on one side and enter a newbie position on the other.

Anyways so long. currently learning how to work with GitHub.

Cheers,
MidLife Machine
